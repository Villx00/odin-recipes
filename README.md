The following is the first project that is issued under the cirriculum of the odin project.


I was tasked with creating a recipe website using the knowledge of html I had learned up until this point. This file, as per the instructions of the aforementioned assigment, will be modified to accomdate information on changes I have made to this project.
Over the past few weeks i added some basic css to colorize the webpage and i added a background image.
