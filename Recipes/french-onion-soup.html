      <p class="info">French onion soup is a soup usually based on meat stock and onions,
         and often served gratineed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top.
         Ancient in origin, the dish underwent a resurgence of popularity in the 1960s
         in the United States due to a greater interest in French cuisine.</p>
